# Automatic Space Weather Data Retrieval, Processing and Visualization System
As it turns out it's going to be my **bachelor's thesis** ;)

## Description
This repo contains code and thesis text for my bachelor's thesis(as the name indicates ;D). It's a system for a fully automatic retrieval, processing and vizualization of selected
parameters of space weather. As mentioned the flow is fully automated using GH Actions and code written in both Python and Go, which also happened to be contenerized for convenience ;D

## Possible future steps
- extending vizualization
- migrating vizualization module to another(faster) framework
- adding simple ML module 
- increasing data retrieval frequency
